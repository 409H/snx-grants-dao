## Title of job: Creation and Deployment of SNX Grants DAO

## Description: 
Create the backend (smart contracts) and the frontend (UI) for the SNX Grants DAO and incorporate MetaMask wallet functionality for a system that enables SNX grants to be deployed to teams and people developing the Synthetix Network.  

## Motivation: 
To enable Synthetix to decentralise the funding of proposals that are worked on by outside developers or developer teams. This enables Synthetix to solve the granting of funds in a public and open forum much similar to how larger corporate entities have a tender process for external contracts. SNX stakeholders will be able to transparently observe all outgoing grants, which contributes to a more engaged community of stakeholders.

## Additional information (e.g. specs): 
- A DAO mimicking some of the lower level functionality of the Moloch DAO.

- Solidity backend deployed on Ethereum mainnet with a ReactJS reading the state.

### Functionality
- Proposal submission: As an external team you can submit a proposal that will be voted on by 5 members who are stakeholders of the Synthetix network the proposal has attached the - Title of Job, Description, Motivation (i.e. purpose of outcome), Additional Information (e.g. specs), Estimated Hours, Price (SNX) and the Ethereum Address. 

- Anti-spam mechanism: A way to prevent the DAO from being spammed with proposals - you must get in contact with a member of the DAO to submit a proposal on your behalf 

- A 2 day wireframe: which prevents anyone from being framed by how others are voting 

- A 7 day voting period: At which point the 5 members vote on the proposal. You only need 4 out of the 5 members to vote YES to pass a proposal.  

Once Voted: Funds executed or Not depending out the outcome of the proposal 

## Estimated hours: 
- 55 Hours Backend Contracts Build & Test

- 75 Hours Frontend Deployment & Testing (Wallet Integration)

- 10 Hours Original Idea Mapping and Coordination with the Synthetix team

- 140 Hours Total

## Price (SNX): 
- 5500 SNX (Approx. $50 USD/hour at current prices)

## Ethereum Address: 
- 0xC3Ac2a9AfE64E24048F922C76cacB4216A9C6522
